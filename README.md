# CowFarm
Interview question to implement farm management system without using any Java List implementation
This it an interview question I got. I hope I remember it correctlly

Asumming thet the farmer has a root cow that never dies.

* Cow can have more then one calf
* Cow can die, and when do needs to be remove from the herd.
* The farmer wants to know who is the mother of a calf even if she dies
* Farmer wants to get a report of its cows herd....(Name, Generation, Mother name, etc)

You need to implement command prompt which enable:
1. Add cow
2. Remove cow
3. Print herd information

You not allow to use any pre build java implementation of Array, Collections or List
